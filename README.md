Travelling is an enriching experience that allows individuals to explore new cultures, discover breathtaking landscapes, and create lasting memories. However, many travellers struggle to effectively document and share their travel experiences in a cohesive and personalised manner. For instance, traditional methods of documenting travels such as pen-and-paper journals often fail to encapsulate depth and breadth of one’s travel journeys, resulting in fragmented documentations. Although there are multiple travel blog websites such as The Travel Blog, their cluttered, aesthetically unappealing user interface fails to provide a pleasant user experience.

Alternatively, travellers turn to social media platforms to document their travel experiences. Although they can post their travel stories, these platforms typically prioritise real-time updates and lack the depth necessary for them to reflect on and preserve their travel experiences over time. As a result, travellers may find it difficult to revisit and relive their adventures or share them with others in a meaningful way.

Hence, TravelPal intends to address the problem of ineffective documentation of travel experiences and difficulty in revisiting them by allowing users to easily document their travels in great detail. TravelPal is a travel blogging web application that aids users to document their travel experiences and gain inspiration from top-rated travel journeys posted by others.

With TravelPal, users can effortlessly document their travel journey, having the option to document as a personal trip or a guide to publicly share their experience with other users. They can seamlessly store multimedia content such as trip photos to vividly describe their travel experiences, helping them to deeply reflect and create personalised blogs that they can revisit or share with others. Personalisation of users’ blogging experience is further enhanced with a curated user profile for each user. In TravelPal, users can input preferences such as travel habits, personal interests and travel bucket list. As users log their travel adventures, travel analytics such as the number of countries visited will be updated to help them gain valuable insights on their travel journey. With TravelPal, apart from creating a personalised travel blogging experience for users, it emboldens their future travels. Using the Explore feature, users can browse a variety of curated guides from sections such as Editors’ Choice, Regional Favourites and Recently Added. This fuels their discovery of new and relevant information which can greatly inspire their future trips.

As such, TravelPal aims to provide modern travellers, who have a greater interest in documenting, preserving and sharing their travel journeys, a simple yet personalised travel blogging experience. Its simple yet minimalistic user interface makes TravelPal aesthetically-pleasing and intuitive to use, increasing user engagement.
